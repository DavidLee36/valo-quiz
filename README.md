# Valorant Quiz Website

This project is a **Valorant Quiz Website** that I am building to expand my knowledge of **PHP** and **MySQL**. The website allows users to take quizzes that test their knowledge of the game Valorant, with questions ranging from character abilities, weapons, maps, and general game knowledge.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a simple quiz platform for Riot Games' Valorant. Users will be able to:

- Answer multiple-choice questions about different aspects of the game.
- Questions are categorized into various topics like **Maps**, **Character Abilities**, **Weapons**, **Lore**, and **General Knowledge**.
- Be able to track completed questions along with number of correct/failed attempts

The website is built mainly using **PHP** for backend functionality, and **MySQL** for managing and storing the quiz questions and user data.

## Status

- Project is now hosted and available to be used at [valo-quiz.com](https://valo-quiz.com)
- Implemented full **admin functionality** to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on quiz questions and question categories.
- Implemented user functionality to sign in and track user data

## Future Features
