# Valorant Quiz Website

This project is a **Valorant Quiz Website** that I am building to expand my knowledge of **PHP** and **MySQL**. The website allows users to take quizzes that test their knowledge of the game Valorant, with questions ranging from character abilities, weapons, maps, and general game knowledge.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a simple quiz platform focused on Valorant. Users will be able to:

- Answer multiple-choice questions about different aspects of the game.
- Questions are categorized into various topics like **Maps**, **Character Abilities**, **Weapons**, **Lore**, and **General Knowledge**.

The website is built mainly using **PHP** for backend functionality and **MySQL** for managing and storing the quiz questions and user data.

## Status

- The project is still under development.
- The database itself **not currently included** in this repository.
- Implemented full **admin functionality** to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on quiz questions. However, user authentication is not yet implemented, so anyone can access the admin features at this point.

## Future Features

- Main quiz functionality (most development so far has been on admin functionality)
- User authentication to restrict admin access and ensure only authorized users can edit data.
- User functionality for saving quiz results.
- Improved UI/UX for a better quiz experience.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**
- **MySQL**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **JavaScript**
